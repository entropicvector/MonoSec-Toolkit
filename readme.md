The MonoSec Security toolkit is a comprehensive framework with offensive and defensive security tools.


It is currently still in development by nci* and Flare.


Albert is the original founder and coder of the Monochrome GUI framework, and I am the co-founder. MonoSec is our next endeavor, with myself being the coder. We're hoping to one day expand the "Mono" brand into a worldwide, respected and trusted name.
