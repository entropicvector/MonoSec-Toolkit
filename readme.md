The MonoSec Security toolkit is a comprehensive framework with offensive and defensive security tools.


It is currently still in development by Christian Krenzlin with the help of Albert Slepak.


Albert is the original founder and coder of the Monochrome GUI framework, and I am the co-founder. MonoSec is our next endeavor, with myself being the coder. We're hoping to one day expand the "Mono" brand into a worldwide, respected and trusted name.
